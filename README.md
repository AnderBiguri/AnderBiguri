 Hi, I’m @AnderBiguri, 

See my full profile in [my webpage](https://anderbiguri.github.io/), but in short:
 
 I have a PhD in tomographic reconstruction algorithms. I mostly focus on [Computed Tomography (CT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan) but have also worked in [Positron Emission Tomography (PET)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography)
 and a bit of [Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance_tomography).
 
 Within this context, I have coded the [TIGRE toolbox](https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE) a MATLAB/python + CUDA high performance toolbox for GPU accelerated iterative reconstruction of CT images.
 Mostly proficient in MATLAB, Python (numpy, pytorch, etc) , some C and C++ and CUDA.
 
 Nowadays, I work at University of Cambridge's Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, working on model-driven machine learning techniques for CT recon, and thus making a new library called [LION](https://github.com/CambridgeCIA/LION).
